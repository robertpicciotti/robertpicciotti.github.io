		The Signal Protocol - An Introduction
	</h1>
	<p>
		The Signal Protocol is developed by Open Whisper Systems.
		The project aims to create a secure messaging protocol for use
		in the modern world. The protocol is used in their own app,
		named Signal, along with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and
		Google Allo. The Signal app and WhatsApp both use the protocol
		for all messages, whereas Facebook Messenger and Google Allo
		only use it for "secret messages."
	</p>

	<h2 id="ratchet_intro">
		The Double Ratchet
	</h2>
	<p>
		A notable feature of the protocol is the Double Ratchet
		Algorithm. The ratchet is based on the Diffie Hellman ratchet
		used for Off-The-Record messaging. A key aim was to allow for more secure
		"long lived" conversations. OTR is primarily used for instant messaging,
		where conversations are often ended and both parties reauthenticate the
		next time they communicate. Modern messaging needs tend to be focused on
		long lived conversations, at times spanning years.
		<br>
		<br>
		The author's of the Double Ratchet refer to it as "self-healing." This is
		because it aims to not be compromised because any one messages key is
		compromised. If one message in a conversation is compromised there should
		be no need to worry that the whole conversation is compromised.
		<br>
		<br>
		It is designed to detect when messages are reordered, deleted, or replayed.
	</p>

	<h2 id="primitives_intro">
		The Primitives
	</h2>
	<p>
		The Signal Protocol's primitives are Curve25519, AES-256 and HMAC-SHA256.
	</p>

		Project Abstract
	</h1>

	<p>
		I will do an analysis of the security properties of
		the Double Ratchet Algorithm. The Double Ratchet aims to have
		the unique feature of being "self-healing." Through the use
		of short-lived session keys, it aims to make it impossible to
		compromise future messages even if a previous messaged is
		cracked.
