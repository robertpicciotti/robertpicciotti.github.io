	<h3>
		The Signal Protocol
	</h3>
	<p>
		The Signal Protocol is developed by Open Whisper Systems.
		The project aims to create a secure messaging protocol for use
		in the modern world. The protocol is used in their own app,
		named Signal, along with WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and
		Google Allo. The Signal app and WhatsApp both use the protocol
		for all messages, whereas Facebook Messenger and Google Allo
		only use it for "secret messages."
		<br> <br>
		A notable feature of the protocol is the Double Ratchet
		Algorithm. The ratchet is based on the Diffie Hellman ratchet
		used for Off-The-Record messaging.
	</p>

	<h3> Project Abstract </h3>

	<p>
		I would like to do an analysis of the security properties of
		the Double Ratchet Algorithm. The Double Ratchet aims to have
		the unique feature of being "self-healing." Through the use
		of short-lived session keys, it aims to make it impossible to
		compromise future messages even if a previous messaged is
		cracked.
